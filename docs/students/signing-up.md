# Signing Up 

If a Bible First coach has invited you to sign up, then hopefully you've been given either a web address or a signup key. If you've been given a web address, just visit it and follow the instructions.

*Example web addresses:*
```
https://bfst.co/en/K7YN39
https://biblefirst.online/en/K7YN39/sign_up
```
If you've been given a signup key, [click here](https://biblefirst.online/sign_up) to go to the generic signup form and enter the signup key when prompted.

*An example signup key:*
```

```
If you'd like to sign up for Bible First, but don't have a web address or a signup key, [click here](mailto:hello@biblefirst.online?subject=Signup%20Key%20Request) to request a signup key.
