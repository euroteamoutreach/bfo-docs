# Contacting Your Coach

Want to get in touch with your coach? Just click the envelope icon at the top right of your screen.

It really is that easy!

When your coach responds to you, you'll be notified via email. At that point, you can either respond in the messaging system as described above, or you can just reply to the notification email, and your response will get added to the conversation.

One gotcha: the messaging system is not a *live* messaging system. That means that if your coach sends you a message, it won't show up on the screen until the page is reloaded. So if you aren't seeing something that should be there, just refresh the page.
