# Signing Up

So you'd like to become a Bible First coach? That's great! All you have to do is click on... um...

Well, this is awkward. Turns out we haven't built that part of the app yet. Email us at [support@biblefirst.online](mailto:support@biblefirst.online?subject=Coach%20Account%20Request) to request a coaching account.

## If You Are A Student

Let's say you've been a BFO student in the past, and now you want to be a coach. That's great! Unfortunately, you can't use the same email for your both your student and coach accounts. You could just [delete your student account](/students/editing-your-profile.html#deleting-your-account), and that would solve the problem. Or, if you have a secondary email, you could use it for your coach account, or you could [update your student account](/students/editing-your-profile.html) to use the secondary account, thus freeing up your primary email for your coach account.

### The Gmail Trick

If you have a Gmail address, you have another option. Let's say your email address is myemail@gmail.com. You can [add a plus sign](https://gmail.googleblog.com/2008/03/2-hidden-ways-to-get-more-from-your.html) and some text before the at sign, and Gmail will still recognize it as your email, and any emails sent to it will go right to your inbox. For example: myemail+student@gmail.com.

If you decide to use the Gmail trick, it is recommended to use it with the account that you will use less, as it doesn't work with the ["reply via email"](/coaches/messaging-a-student.html#email-notifications) functionality.

### One Gotcha

When your coach account is created, you will be sent an email with a link to confirm your account. Be sure to sign out of your student account before clicking that link, otherwise the link will just drop you into your student account, instead of confirming your new coach account.
