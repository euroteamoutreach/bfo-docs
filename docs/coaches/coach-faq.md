# Coach FAQ

## What is a Signup Key?

So what exactly is a signup key? A signup key is a short code that is unique to your BFO account. When a person signs up for BFO, the signup key is what connects the new student with the account of the coach that invited them. That said, if you use your signup URLs, you don't have to worry about signup keys, because the signup key is built into the URL.

*An example signup key:*
```
K7YN39
```

*The corresponding signup URLs (notice the signup keys):*
```
https://bfst.co/en/K7YN39
https://biblefirst.online/en/K7YN39/sign_up
```

## How do you scan a QR code?

On iPhone, it should be pretty simple. Open the camera app, point it at the QR code, and it should recognize the code and ask if you want to go to the link. On Android, there are a few extra steps (as of this writing). See [this article](https://www.hellotech.com/guide/for/how-to-scan-qr-code-iphone-android) to learn more, or just Google it.

## What's the difference between the admin and standard coaching accounts?

Standard-level coaches can do everything an admin coach can do, except for deleting students and adding/deleting other coaches.

## What's the difference between online, offline, and hybrid students?

First, a little background. Back in old days, Bible First was exclusively a paper-based course, and all the materials were sent to and from our students through the mail. All Bible First Online did was help us manage our offline students.

The current iteration of Bible First Online retains the old model, but it also allows someone to go through the entire course without a single trip to the mailbox. We anticipate that most coaches and students will go the 100% online route. There is also a third hybrid option, discussed below.

So, here are the three types of students:

* **Online students** log in to their BFO account with their email and password. They read the lessons online, do their quizzes online, and if they go offline, they get reminders via email.

* **Hybrid students** are just like online students, except that their coaches are sending them physical lessons.

* **Offline students** do not have a BFO account. They get physical lessons, quizzes, and if need be, physical reminders.

## Do I have to offer paper lessons to my students?

No, you don't. Whether you offer physical materials to your students is totally up to you.

## If I want to offer paper lessons to my students, where do I get them?

## Why Genesis, and not John or Romans?

To be honest, we'd love to write a course about John and Romans, we just don't have the time! But getting back to the question, [watch this short video](https://www.getbiblefirst.com/training/videos/part-1/video-4/) for the answer.

## What is the rational for using a correspondence course like Bible First?

### And how do I use it to its fullest potential?

We're glad you asked! The answers to these and many other such questions can be found in our [Bible First training videos.](https://www.getbiblefirst.com/training/#video-start) Some of the videos won't apply, as they have to do with running a paper-based course, but the underlying strategy and principles apply to both alike. If you are going to be a Bible First coach, we strongly encourage you to invest the time and watch the videos. You won't regret it!
