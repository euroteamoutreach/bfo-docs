# Coach FAQ

## What is a Signup Key?

So what exactly is a signup key? A signup key is a short code that is unique to your BFO account. When a person signs up for BFO, the signup key is what connects the new student with the account of the coach that invited them. That said, if you use your signup URLs, you don't have to worry about signup keys, because the signup key is built into the URL.

*An example signup key:*
```
K7YN39
```

*The corresponding signup URLs (notice the signup keys):*
```
https://bfst.co/en/K7YN39
https://biblefirst.online/en/K7YN39/sign_up
```

## How do you scan a QR code?

On iPhone, it should be pretty simple. Open the camera app, point it at the QR code, and it should recognize the code and ask if you want to go to the link. On Android, there are a few extra steps (as of this writing). See [this article](https://www.hellotech.com/guide/for/how-to-scan-qr-code-iphone-android) to learn more, or just Google it.
