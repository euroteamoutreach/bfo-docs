# Adding Students

There are a lot of ways to add a new student to your account, but they all start with going to the [Signup Tools](https://biblefirst.online/en/signup_tools) page. If you are already logged in to your account, just click the rocketship icon.

## In-Person Signup

First off, let's assume the person that wants to sign up for Bible First is standing next to you and has a smartphone.

### Smartphone Signup

Tap the Invite Now button, which will bring up a QR code. If someone [scans that code,](/coaches/coach-faq.html#how-do-you-scan-a-qr-code) it will take them to your signup page, where they can create an account.

If someone can't scan the QR code, tap the key icon located below the QR code and to the left.

This will display a link to the signup page as well as your [signup key.](/coaches/coach-faq.html#what-is-a-signup-key) If the prospective student doesn't want to sign up on the spot, they can take a picture of your screen, and sign up later.

### Signup Without a Smartphone

If someone doesn't have a smartphone, you can write down the signup link and key mentioned above and give it to the prospective student. (Better yet, have it printed on a business card or something ahead of time!)

Or, tap the Self Signup button in your Signup Tools.

![self-signup](https://res.cloudinary.com/euro-team-outreach/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:best/v1609422020/bfo/bfo-docs/adding-students/self-signup_j2acmd.png)

This will log you out of your BFO account, and redirect you to the signup page. Then, hand your phone to the prospective student and have them create an account. (They won't be able to *completely* create their account until they get access to their email, but the confirmation email should be waiting for them in their inbox.)

## Remote Signup

Now let's consider the situation where the prospective student is not standing right next to you. The simplest way for them to sign up is with a signup URL. On your Signup Tools page, scroll down to the Coach Resources section and copy either the Signup URL or the Short Signup URL. (Both go to the same place, but there is a short one for times when space is limited.)

![signup-urls](https://res.cloudinary.com/euro-team-outreach/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:best/v1609422021/bfo/bfo-docs/adding-students/signup-urls_cbgonw.png)

You can then send your signup URL to the prospective student via text, email, or Morse code. Also, consider sending them a link to our handy-dandy, [how-to-sign-up help page](/students/signing-up.html) for students:
```
https://docs.biblefirst.online/students/signing-up.html
```

## Manual Signup

Last, but not least, you can sign up a student yourself, providing they have given you their consent and the pertinent info. Go to the [Add Student](https://biblefirst.online/en/coach/students/new) page, and fill in all the appropriate fields.

![add-student-page](https://res.cloudinary.com/euro-team-outreach/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:best/v1609422020/bfo/bfo-docs/adding-students/add-student-page_meslma.png)

Once you click "Add Student", the student will be sent a confirmation email. When they click the confirmation link in that email, they will be ready to go!

## Printed Promotional Materials

When designing materials to advertise BFO (tracts, business cards, etc.), be sure to include your QR code as well as your signup URL, as QR codes reduce the amount of typing a person has to do. (Your QR code will take a person to the same place as your signup URL.) Look for the little QR code icons next to the signup URLs.

![qr-codes](https://res.cloudinary.com/euro-team-outreach/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:best/v1609422020/bfo/bfo-docs/adding-students/qr-codes_yhn5vb.png)

*Fun fact: a QR code is like a bar code. It's basically text encoded in a format that can be read by a smartphone.*
