# Grading Quizzes

Once a student has completed their quiz, it will show up on your [dashboard](https://biblefirst.online/en/dashboard). Just click the Grade icon to the right to begin grading.

Alternatively, you can start the grading process from the student's [profile page.](/coaches/student-profile-page.html#finding-a-student-s-profile)

All the answers default to being marked as correct. Click the green toggle switch to mark the answer as incorrect.

Be sure to make use of the comment fields under each question to provide feedback, clarification, or point the student in the direction of the correct answer.

Once you finish grading the quiz, click the Grade Quiz button at the bottom of the page. The student will be notified via email that their quiz has been graded, and the next lesson will be unlocked for them to read.

## Declining a Quiz

You'll also notice the Decline Quiz button, right next to the Grade Quiz button. This is for those rare occasions when the student did a really poor job on the quiz, or perhaps just accidentally submitted their quiz before finishing it. Declining a quiz returns it to the student and allows them to edit their answers. They can then resubmit it for grading just like normal.

If you do have to decline a quiz, be sure to send the student [a message](/coaches/messaging-a-student.html) and let them know the reason.

BUG ALERT: The confirmation window for declining a student currently asks for a reason for the declining, but doesn't provide a place to enter that reason. Hence the above suggestion to send the student a message.
