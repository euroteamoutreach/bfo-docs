## What denomination do you belong to?

While Bible First was written and published by [Euro Team Outreach](https://www.euroteamoutreach.org/) (ETO), it is important to note that most Bible First coaches are not officially affiliated with ETO, and come from a variety of denominational backgrounds.

But getting back to the question, ETO is not affiliated with any denomination. If you really feel the need to put us in a box, take a look at our [statement of faith,](https://www.euroteamoutreach.org/doctrine/) and then feel free to put is in whatever box you'd like!
